# API documentation and specification for SOA grupp 2

The following APIS should exist in this repo:

- mock Ladok
- mock Epok
- mock studentITS
- mock Canvas?
- student-service, internal
- examination-service, internal
- combined services, external (for frontend web interface)


These follow the OpenAPI specification version 3 (Swagger).


Recommended toolset for working with these files is [Stoplight Studio](https://github.com/stoplightio/studio) or at [Stoplight.io](https://stoplight.io/studio). The .yml files can be opened in programs such as Postman and then run automated tests agains an API implementation.


There are numerous tools to autogenerate documentation from these API specifications, they are also useful for running tests with and providing the configuration for test servers - as well as just being a centeral source of truth to write the API implementations for.
